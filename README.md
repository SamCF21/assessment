# ðŸŒ¾ Crop Classifier Web App (Cloud-Based)

This project is a full-stack web application that allows users to receive crop recommendations based on soil and environmental conditions. The solution is powered by a trained neural network model deployed in our university's cloud infrastructure.

Users interact through a web interface, and their input is processed in the backend via an API, which returns the most suitable crop to plant.

## ðŸš€ Project Goals

- Deploy a machine learning crop classifier in the cloud.
- Build a user-friendly frontend for data input.
- Connect frontend and backend through a RESTful API.
- Support users with intelligent crop recommendations.
